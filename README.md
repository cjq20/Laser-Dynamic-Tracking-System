# Laser-Dynamic-Tracking-System
This project implements a Laser Dynamic Tracking System based on STM32 microcontroller and K210 vision module.It consists of two main subsystemsï¼šMotion Control System and  Target Tracking System.The motion control and tracking subsystems work independently, with communication between them handled by C and Python for seamless operation.
